## AirBnB Clone Project
#### Project Description

 The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. The complete web application will be composed by:
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects)
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

Getting Started
To start the command interpreter type in these commands in your terminal:

Cloning the repo and starting the console:
================================
git clone https://github.com/Devkamara/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB_clone
Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
Also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$  echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
================================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
==============================
EOF help quit
(hbnb)
$
